# üìé Clippy 2.Oh: Your Slightly-Less-Annoying* Desktop AI Pal! ‚ú®

Oh, hi there! üëã Remember me? Of course you do! Well, guess what? I've had a bit of an upgrade. Welcome to **Clippy 2.Oh** (two point Oh)!

This project brings my familiar face back to your desktop, but now I'm powered by modern tech! I'm built with Python, the lovely **PySide6** (Qt), and I get my brains from **OpenRouter.ai**, letting me tap into all sorts of cool AI models! Think of it as the classic paperclip charm, now with more *intelligence* (and hopefully fewer interruptions... maybe).

I'll hang out on your desktop, ready to chat when you need me. Let's see what **Clippy 2.Oh** can do!

## ‚ú® Features - What Can Clippy 2.Oh Do?

*   üß† **Conversational AI** via OpenRouter (ChatBot-style - I've been studying!)
*   üéûÔ∏è **Animated character** (with idle and thinking states - gotta look busy!)
*   üí¨ **Custom speech bubble UI** with tail (Just like you remember, but fancier!)
*   ‚å®Ô∏è **Click-to-chat input box** (Tap me, let's talk!)
*   üñ±Ô∏è **Draggable, floating character window** (Put me wherever you need assistance... or just company!)
*   ü™ü **System tray integration** Closes to tray (Show / Hide / Quit - I promise I'll go away if you ask nicely!)
*   üíö **Positive personality** via a custom system prompt - Feel free to tweak my attitude!

To bring **Clippy 2.Oh** to life, make sure you have:

1.  **Python 3.7+**
2.  **Required Libraries:** Install 'em easily!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration - Let's Get Me Running!

Ready for your very own **Clippy 2.Oh**? Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you grab the right code!
    git clone https://github.com/bm-github/clippy2-oh.git
    cd clippy2-oh
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:** (If you skipped the step above)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configure API Access (Super Important! ‚ú®):**
    *   You need an API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/). Go grab one! It's like my new brain fuel.
    *   Create a file named `.env` right here in the main project folder.
    *   Add your API key and *optionally* choose a specific model:
        ```dotenv
        # .env file contents
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE"
        OPENROUTER_MODEL="YOUR_OPENROUTER_MODEL"
        ```
4.  **Character Assets:** üñºÔ∏è
    *   Make sure you have these files in the same folder (or change the paths in `clippy2-oh.py`):
        *   `character_idle.png` (or `character_idle.gif`)
        *   `character_busy.png` (or `character_busy.gif`)
        *   `tray_icon.png` (a little 32x32 guy for the system tray)

## üöÄ Usage - How to Chat With Clippy 2.Oh!

It's super easy:

1.  **Run the Script (Windowless Mode!):**
    ```bash
    # On Windows/Mac, 'pythonw' often prevents an extra console window!
    pythonw clippy2-oh.py
    # If 'pythonw' isn't found or you want the console, just use 'python':
    # python clippy2-oh.py
    ```
2.  **Say Hello!** I should pop up on your screen (probably bottom-right, classic spot!).
3.  **Click Me!** The input box appears below me. Let's chat!
4.  **Ask Away!** Type your question or prompt, press `Enter` or click `Send`.
5.  **Thinking...** I'll change my look (`busy`) and show a "Thinking..." bubble while I consult the AI overlords (my new colleagues!). ü§î
6.  **Voil√†!** My (or the AI's) response appears in the speech bubble! Hopefully helpful!
7.  **Move Me Around!** Click and drag me anywhere you like. I'm flexible!
8.  **Use the Tray!** Remember the system tray icon üìé for hiding, showing, or quitting. Easy peasy.

## üí° Customisation & Notes - Make Clippy 2.Oh Your Own!

Want to tinker with **Clippy 2.Oh**? Go for it!

*   **Appearance:** Swap out `character_idle.png`/`.gif`, `character_busy.png`/`.gif`, and `tray_icon.png` with your own images! (Check `CHARACTER_WIDTH`/`HEIGHT` in the script for size hints). Maybe give me a party hat?
*   **Personality:** Edit the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable near the top of `clippy2-oh.py`. This is where you tell the AI how to act! Make me sassy, serious, or super-duper helpful! ‚ú®
*   **AI Brain:** Change `OPENROUTER_MODEL` in your `.env` file to try different AI models from OpenRouter. Experiment with my intelligence!
*   **Sizes & Colors:** Adjust constants like `BUBBLE_WIDTH`, `BUBBLE_FILL_COLOR`, etc., at the beginning of `clippy2-oh.py`. Match your desktop theme!
*   **History Limit:** Just FYI, I only remember the last `MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES` (default: 10) messages between us. My memory isn't *infinite*... yet!
*   **Look & Feel:** All the windows are frameless and transparent for that sleek, modern overlay vibe. **2.Oh** style!
